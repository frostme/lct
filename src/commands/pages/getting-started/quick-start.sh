# Implementation for the 'lct pages getting-started quick-start' command.
# This command is wrapped by a function named
# 'lct_pages_getting_started_quick_start_command()' by the surrounding framework.
#
# NOTE: This is currently a no-op stub. Add the desired behavior for the
# 'quick-start' command below without removing this documentation block.
#
# Example structure for future implementation:
# case "$1" in
#   --help|-h)
#     echo "Usage: lct pages getting-started quick-start [options]"
#     ;;
#   *)
#     # TODO: Implement quick-start behavior.
#     ;;
# esac
#
# For now, simply succeed without performing any action.

# Allow this script to be used both inside a function (via `return`) and
# as a standalone script (via `exit`), without causing shell errors.
return 0 2>/dev/null || exit 0
